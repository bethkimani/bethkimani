Full-Stack Developer Experience

I am an aspiring full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, gained through academic studies, practical projects, and professional training. My experience showcases a balanced skill set in building, maintaining, and optimizing web applications.

Front-End Development:
I am proficient in crafting responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with advanced skills in frameworks like React for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

Back-End Development:
I have hands-on experience in server-side programming using Python (Flask) and PHP, as well as managing relational databases with SQL. I have also created and integrated APIs, ensuring seamless communication between systems.

Full-Stack Projects:

Developed a dynamic timetable system during my college attachment, transitioning the timetable from a manual format to an online, term-based system with real-time user access.
Created an online lecturer evaluation form and linked it to an institutional portal, improving efficiency in data collection and management.
Collaborated on a college app development project, contributing to both front-end design and back-end logic.
Designed and implemented APIs to streamline operations and enhance system capabilities.
Tools and Technologies:
Skilled in using Git and GitHub for version control and project collaboration. I code primarily using Visual Studio Code and work in a Ubuntu development environment for seamless application testing and deployment.

Current Focus:
I am enrolled in a 24-week software engineering program at Moringa School, specializing in full-stack development. This program emphasizes creating robust, scalable applications and further enhances my technical expertise and problem-solving skills.

Additional Technical Skills:
Alongside my full-stack development capabilities, I have knowledge in computer hardware, networking, and maintenance, which complements my ability to manage development environments effectively.
